This document is a high-level description of the model used in PhET's _Center and Variability_ simulation.

The Center and Variability simulation is designed to help students visualize and understand concepts in statistics,
specifically relating to mean, median, and measures of spread. The main functionalities of the simulation include:

## Creating distributions of kicked soccer balls

The simulation allows students to kick soccer balls onto the field, creating a distribution of distances. On the "
Median" and "Mean & Median" screens, the kicker changes after each kick, creating a distribution of kicks by different
players. On the "Variability" screen, the student can choose between four kickers, creating the opportunity to compare
distributions of kicks per player.

## Customizing distributions of kicked soccer balls

The simulation allows students to change the kicked distance of a landed soccer ball by dragging the soccer ball to a
new location.

## Sorting data with cards

On the Median screen, students are encouraged to manually sort the cards in the Accordion Box into numerical order.
Checking the Sort Data checkbox auto-sorts existing cards and any new cards created when additional soccer balls are
kicked.

## Analyzing data with plots

On the "Mean & Median" and "Variability" screens, an abstract representation of the soccer ball data is plotted using
an 'x' or a '‚óè' as the data point. The mean, median, and measures of variability can be visually displayed on the
abstract representation to help students find meaning in these measures.

Overall, the Center and Variability simulation is a powerful tool for students as they explore, visualize, and compare
measures of center and spread. Students gain a deeper understanding of mean and median, how they compare, and learn ways
in which distributions can be created, described, analyzed, and used to draw conclusions based on the center and spread.

## Common Controls

* The simulation comprises a field in which soccer balls can be kicked or moved, and an Accordion Box in which an
  abstract representation of the soccer ball data is displayed for student analysis.
* Measures of center and variability are explained in the info dialogs, shown by clicking the button in the top-right
  corner of each accordion box.
* A soccer ball is considered a data point that has a null value until it lands, at which point the ball takes the
  numerical value of its location on the number line.
* Values that do not have enough data to compute are depicted with "?"

### Measures of Center

* The mean is computed as the sum of the data points divided by the number of data points.
* The median is the value of the middle data point when the data is sorted. If there are an even number of data points,
  the median is the average of the two middle data values.

### Measures of Spread

* Range: the maximum data value minus the minimum data value. At least one data point is needed to compute the range.
* IQR (interquartile range): the range of the middle 50% of the data. The IQR is computed by taking the difference
  between the 1st and 3rd quartile values. At least 5 data points are needed to construct the boxplot and calculate the
  IQR.
* The MAD (mean absolute deviation): the average of the absolute values of all deviations. This is calculated by finding
  the distance between the mean and each data point, then finding the mean of these distances. Note that the absolute
  deviations from the mean are rounded to the nearest 0.1. This means the final MAD value may differ slightly from the
  actual (non-rounded) MAD. At least one data point is needed to compute the MAD.

### Kick Distribution Strategies

Median and Mean & Median Screens

* Random Skew: The kick distributions are randomly chosen to be skewed left or right. The skew is randomly chosen on
  startup and on reset-all (
  but not upon clearing the field with the eraser button).
* Random: The kicks are randomly distributed.

Variability Screen

* Kicker 1 is unimodal and symmetric with a small standard deviation
* Kicker 2 is unimodal and symmetric with a larger standard deviation
* Kicker 3 will kick a skewed right distribution
* Kicker 4 will kick a skewed left distribution.
